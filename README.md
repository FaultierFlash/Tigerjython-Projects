A nice variety of different projects that were created during especially boring sections of high school informatics lessons. 

Special note should be taken of the turtle implementation of Conway's Game of Life, which stretches the capabilities of the little turtle that has to jump around and recolour all the different tiles as the game updates.

If anyone actually wants to test these, just paste the code into the TigerJython editor and press run. I'm optimistic most of these should work pretty well, though it has been a while.
